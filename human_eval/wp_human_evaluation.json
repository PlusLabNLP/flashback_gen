    "the slums were the most beautiful in the world. they were the only ones that could afford to live in them. it wasn't the most glamorous of jobs, but it was the most exciting of all. the slums didn't have to be crowded, they were just as beautiful as the rest of the city. the only problem was that the people who lived in them were the ones who weren't able to afford to afford the luxuries.  the slum was the only place where people could live in peace. the people that lived in it were the richest people in the country. they lived in luxury, and they could afford everything they wanted.  there was one problem though. there were too many people living in this slum. they couldn't afford to buy enough food, or they could not afford to rent a room. there was no one to take care of them, and there was nobody to help them.  it was a problem for the people in this city. they had to live with each other, to survive, to be able to survive.  they had no choice but to do what they wanted to do. they would live in their own homes, with their own food, their own clothes, and their own cars.  one day, however, one of the people decided to take a trip to the city, and he decided to stay. he went to the nearby park and looked out the window. the city was beautiful, and the people lived happily ever after.  he went home, and went to bed. he woke up the next morning, and fell asleep in his own bed.  a few hours later, he awoke to the sound of his alarm clock ringing. he looked around, and saw that it was time to go to work. he jumped out of bed, and made his way to the kitchen. he opened the fridge, and took a bite of his cereal. he ate it all, and ate the rest.  -- -  thanks for reading! if you enjoyed this, check out more of my stuff at /r/written4reddit.",
